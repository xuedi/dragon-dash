# Authentication

dragon-dash has one login, for the owner. It guards everything that changes something and the
Settings page. The dashboards themselves stay open to anyone on the network, like a display on the
wall.

## What needs a login

| | Without a session | Logged in |
|---|---|---|
| dashboards, charts, the floor plan | shown | shown, plus Upload and Edit |
| any write under `/s/<id>/api/` | 401 | allowed |
| Settings | redirected to the login | shown |
| `/metrics`, `/static/` | open | open |

`/metrics` is open because Prometheus scrapes it and has no session to offer.

The check sits in the shell, not in the systems. Every request that is not `GET`, `HEAD` or
`OPTIONS` under `/s/<id>/api/` needs a session, the same place the cross-origin check already sits,
so a write endpoint a future system adds is covered without anyone having to remember it. A system
only asks `system.CanEdit` whether to draw its edit controls, see [systems.md](systems.md).

**With no login configured, nothing can be changed.** Writes answer 403, no page offers an edit
control, and Settings stays open as it was before there was a login, so a fresh install can still
be inspected. That is the safe default: an upgrade from a version without a login loses the Upload
and Edit buttons until the two lines below are added, rather than leaving them open.

## Configuring it

Two lines in the env file, like every other setting:

```ini
DD_CORE_AUTH_USER=admin
DD_CORE_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH=pbkdf2-sha256:600000:<salt>:<key>
```

`dragon-dash passwd` asks for the password twice, without echo, and prints both lines. It writes no
file. Configuration is only ever changed by editing the env file and restarting, so there is no page
and no command that can quietly change who may log in; changing the password is running `passwd`
again. Setting one of the two without the other, or a damaged hash, refuses to start, rather than
starting with a login nobody can pass.

The hash is **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256**, 600,000 iterations, a 16-byte random salt and a 32-byte key,
written as `pbkdf2-sha256:<iterations>:<salt>:<key>` in unpadded base64url. That alphabet has no
`$`, `=` or quotes, so no env loader or Compose file tries to interpret it. The comparison is in
constant time.

PBKDF2 rather than bcrypt or argon2 because it is in Go's standard library and the project takes no
external modules. At this iteration count it is OWASP's current recommendation for it. The iteration
count is part of the stored hash, so raising it later does not invalidate an existing one.

## Sessions

A successful login gets a random 32-byte session id in a cookie:

- `HttpOnly`, so no script on the page can read it
- `SameSite=Lax`, so another site cannot send it along with a form post
- `Secure` only when the login came over HTTPS; on a plain-HTTP LAN install a `Secure` cookie would
  never be stored at all
- valid for 7 days, counted from the login

The expiry is kept **on the server**, not only in the cookie, so a copied cookie stops working on
time whatever the browser was told. Sessions live in memory, and a restart logs everyone out. For a
single owner that is a smaller cost than a session file on disk. Log out deletes the session on the
server as well as the cookie.

Login and logout go through the same cross-origin protection as the system endpoints, and logout is
a form post rather than a link, so another page cannot log the owner out either.

After logging in, the browser returns to the page it came from. Only a path on this site is
accepted; anything that a browser would read as another host, `//host` or `/\host` among them, goes
to the start page instead.

## Guessing

Every attempt runs exactly **one** password check against the one configured hash, whatever user
name was typed, so the time an attempt takes does not reveal whether the name was right. A wrong
name and a wrong password get the same answer.

Failed attempts are counted **per client address**: 10 failures within 15 minutes lock that address
out for 15 minutes, with `429` and `Retry-After`. A successful login clears the count.

There is deliberately no per-account lock. With one account it would let anyone on the network lock
the owner out on purpose, by failing with the owner's name. And `X-Forwarded-For` is never read:
dragon-dash terminates TLS itself with no proxy in front, and trusting a header anyone can set would
let a guesser pick a fresh address for every attempt.

## Rejected

- **A setup page that creates the account.** It needs the app to write its own configuration, which
  is exactly what dragon-dash does not do. `passwd` prints, the operator pastes.
- **More than one user, or roles.** A dashboard needs an owner, not user management.
- **A signed cookie holding the session.** It cannot be revoked before it expires; a server-side
  session ends the moment the owner logs out.
- **Locking the whole dashboard.** The pages show readings, not credentials. Settings, which names
  hosts and users, is behind the login.
